# JavaScript pizzeria

The task ia to make a .js pizzeria with different options giving different outcomes.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I really enjoyed this project! So far javascript makes a lot of sense to me. I've had some difficulties, specially with the default in the switch. I never got it to work. I googled, asked fellow students during my demo this week, asked chatgpt, but I could't figure out the problem. I tried several different things, like parseInt that chatGPT suggested. But I couldnt wrap my head around why it didn't work. 

For the planning I just followed the different steps that was commented out in the js file. When I got stuck on one thing I commented that out to figure it out later and then moved on to the next step just to keep the wheels spinning and not quit when it got hard. For me it's easier to start the next time if I didn't end "on bad terms" with the code the day before ':D

If I had more time I'd want to condition the input field where you write your name so it would show an error if numbers were to be typed in there. 
I'd also want to an error to show and the pop up to close if an undefined meal is chosen. Now it just continues with all the "usual" steps even if there's an error made.
